# UVA Community Alerts

When is it too late to walk home alone? I don't know, but I can show you a histogram of the times of incidents that Timothy Longo told us all about. Check out [Analysis.ipynb] or run a local copy if you want to tinker:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```

## Data source

I searched my UVA inbox for emails with "Community Alert" in the subject line and exported these using Google Takeout. I removed some headers and took out tracking links for privacy.
