The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
University (Non-Confidential) Resources: For information regarding resources and reporting options, you are encouraged to contact the University&rsquo;s Title IX Coordinator at 
mailto:titleixcoordinator@virginia.edu 
titleixcoordinator@virginia.edu  or at (434) 297-7988, the Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights at 
mailto:uvaeocr@virginia.edu 
uvaeocr@virginia.edu  or (434) 924-3200,  the Office of the Dean of Students by phone at (434) 924-7133, or the University Police Department at (434) 924-7166. A Student Resource Guide and other information is also available on the following websites:

Prevention Tips
	- If possible, don&rsquo;t walk alone during late-night hours. Walk in groups whenever you can. There is safety in numbers.
	- Use Safe Ride. Put their number (434-242-1122) into your speed dial. Know the Safe Ride service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- The University Police Department offers two types of self-defense classes to the University community. The first class is the R.A.D. women&rsquo;s self-defense course. This is a 12-hour multi-session course. The second class is a one-time, two-hour basic self-defense course. There is no cost to attend these classes.
	- Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lots, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually not well-lit or heavily traveled.
	- Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones, don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises.
	- If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.
	- Know your neighborhood. Identify police and fire stations, libraries, emergency telephones &ndash; as well as the hours of operation of local stores and restaurants.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911

A description of the suspect was not provided.=09<h1>The University of Virg=
inia shares this information to protect members of the University community=
, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to=
 raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.</h1=
>

<ul>
=09<li>No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsibl=
e for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following sugge=
stions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may impr=
ove opportunities to receive prompt assistance.</li>
=09<li>Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong=
, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.</li>
=09<li>Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful o=
r inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how =
you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scena=
rios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#=
39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.</li>
=09<li>Invite a Green Dot facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or org=
anization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understand=
ing of these issues by inviting a peer educator from One Less or One in Fou=
r to present to your organization.</li>
=09<li>If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who u=
nderstands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women=
&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to d=
evelop a safety plan.</li>
=09<li>If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, su=
ch as the Yellow Cab program and UPD&rsquo;s Safe Ride. Put their number, (=
434) 242-1122 into your speed dial. Know the service area and hours by visi=
ting <a href=3D"http://www.virginia.edu/parking/saferide/">http://www.virgi=
nia.edu/parking/saferide/</a>.</li>
=09<li>If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blu=
e light emergency phone or call 911.</li>
=09<li>If you are being stalked, share this information with people who can=
 help keep you safe. Use the stalking tracking form on the UVA resources we=
bsite and speak to professionals to help develop a safety plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>University (Non-Confidential) Resources: For information regarding resou=
rces and reporting options, you are encouraged to contact the University&rs=
quo;s Title IX Coordinator at <a href=3D"mailto:titleixcoordinator@virginia=
.edu">titleixcoordinator@virginia.edu</a> or at (434) 297-7988, the Office =

<h1>Prevention Tips</h1>

<ul>
=09<li>If possible, don&rsquo;t walk alone during late-night hours. Walk in=
 groups whenever you can. There is safety in numbers.</li>
=09<li>Use Safe Ride. Put their number (434-242-1122) into your speed dial.=
 Know the service area and hours by visiting <a href=3D"http://www.virginia=
.edu/parking/saferide/">http://www.virginia.edu/parking/saferide/</a>.</li>
=09<li>If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blu=
e light emergency phone or call 911.</li>
=09<li>The University Police Department offers two types of self-defense cl=
asses to the University community. The first class is the R.A.D. women&rsqu=
o;s self-defense course. This is a 12-hour multi-session course. The second=
 class is a one-time, two-hour basic self-defense course. There is no cost =
to attend these classes.</li>
=09<li>Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lot=
s, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually n=
ot well-lit or heavily traveled.</li>
=09<li>Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones,=
 don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises=
.</li>
=09<li>If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.</li>
=09<li>Know your neighborhood. Identify police and fire stations, libraries=
, emergency telephones &ndash; as well as the hours of operation of local s=
tores and restaurants.</li>
</ul>

ing home, i.e., a trusted friend, taxi, or Safe Ride if available.</li>
=09<li>Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful o=
r inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how =
you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scena=
rios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#=
39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.</li>
=09<li>Invite a Green Dot facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or org=
anization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understand=
ing of these issues by inviting a peer educator from One Less or One in Fou=
r to present to your organization.</li>
=09<li>If someone is behaving disrespectfully or making you feel uncomforta=
ble, take steps to remove yourself from the situation early, especially if =
you are concerned it may become physical.</li>
=09<li>If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who u=
nderstands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women=
&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to d=
evelop a safety plan.</li>
=09<li>If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, su=

=09<li>If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blu=
e light emergency phone or call 911.</li>
=09<li>You have the right to defend your body, your personal integrity, you=
rself.</li>
=09<li>Do not second-guess yourself or the intentions of the person harming=
 you. If you have indicated that you do not want to engage in a particular =
sexual activity and your partner ignores you, take this as a sign that he o=
r she has no intention of taking your feelings into consideration. This wil=
l help you decide what to do next.</li>
=09<li>There is no shame in being a victim. Talk to someone who has knowled=
ge of community and university resources. There are many people on Grounds =
and in the community who can help you identify resources and options and wh=
o may be able to reduce the impact on your well-being and help you end the =
abuse.</li>
=09<li>If you are being stalked, share this information with people who can=
 help keep you safe. Use the stalking tracking form on the UVA resources we=
bsite and speak to professionals to help develop a safety plan.</li>
=09<li>Your voice and your body are your best weapons. Learn effective ways=
 to use them by taking a self-defense class, and bring a friend with you.</=

<h1>The following is a list of forms of sexual assault. They are also a vio=
lation of the University of Virginia&#39;s Policy on Sexual and Gender-Base=
d Harassment and other Forms of Interpersonal Violence:</h1>

<ul>
=09<li>Having intercourse with another person without their consent.</li>
=09<li>Having intercourse with another person by force or threat of force.<=
/li>
=09<li>Having intercourse with another person who is incapacitated and as a=
 result, unable to give consent. Incapacitation can be caused by voluntary =
intoxication by the victim or by the perpetrator intentionally inducing ing=
estion of alcohol or drugs to cause incapacitation.</li>
=09<li>Having intercourse with another person after spiking that person&rsq=
uo;s drink with date-rape or predatory drugs in order to induce incapacitat=
ion so that the person cannot resist or recall the incident.</li>
=09<li>Having intercourse with a person who is asleep, unconscious or other=
wise unaware the intercourse is occurring.</li>
=09<li>Using threats, intimidation or coercion (unreasonable pressure) to c=
ompel someone to have intercourse against their will.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Sexual Intercourse is:</h1>

<ul>
=09<li>Any penetration</li>
=09<li>However slight</li>
=09<li>With any object or body part</li>
=09<li>Performed by a person upon another person</li>
</ul>

<h1>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CONSENT</h1>

<ul>
=09<li>Affirmative consent must be present for all forms of sexual activity=
. Affirmative Consent is informed (knowing), voluntary (freely given), and =
active (not passive), meaning that, through the demonstration of clear word=
s or actions, a person has indicated permission to engage in mutually agree=
d-upon sexual activity.</li>
=09<li>Affirmative Consent cannot be obtained by Force. Force includes the =
use of physical violence, threats, intimidation, and/or coercion.</li>
=09<li>Affirmative Consent cannot be gained by taking advantage of the inca=
pacitation of another, where the person initiating sexual activity knew or =
reasonably should have known that the other was incapacitated. Incapacitati=
on means that a person lacks the ability to make informed, rational judgmen=
ts about whether or not to engage in sexual activity.</li>

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a Green Dot facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from One Less or One in Four to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting

Prevention Tips
	- If possible, don&rsquo;t walk alone during late-night hours. Walk in groups whenever you can&mdash;there is safety in numbers.
	- Use Safe Ride. Put their number (434-242-1122) into your speed dial. Know the Safe Ride service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- If you are confronted, COOPERATE! Give the criminal what he/she asks for - wallet, keys, jewelry, credit cards, and electronics. Your life is more valuable than replaceable possessions. Don&rsquo;t make sudden moves or try to apprehend the criminal yourself. Concentrate on remembering a description and call police immediately.
	- Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lots, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually not well-lit or heavily traveled.
	- Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones, don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises.
	- If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.
	- Know your neighborhood. Identify police and fire stations, libraries, emergency telephones &ndash; as well as the hours of operation of local stores and restaurants.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- The most common type of sexual assault occurs between individuals known to one another, including an acquaintance or in the context of a current or prior dating or domestic relationship.
	- Alcohol and drugs are often used to create vulnerability to sexual assault. Studies of sexual assault incidents show a high correlation between non-stranger sexual assault and drug/alcohol usage. Be alert to people pressuring you or others to use alcohol or other drugs.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Use and encourage others to have a companion or a safe means of getting home, i.e., a trusted friend, taxi, or Safe Ride if available.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If someone is behaving disrespectfully or making you feel uncomfortable, take steps to remove yourself from the situation early, especially if you are concerned it may become physical.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- You have the right to defend your body, your personal integrity, yourself.
	- Do not second-guess yourself or the intentions of the person harming you. If you have indicated that you do not want to engage in a particular sexual activity and your partner ignores you, take this as a sign that he or she has no intention of taking your feelings into consideration. This will help you decide what to do next.
	- There is no shame in being a victim. Talk to someone who has knowledge of community and university resources. There are many people on Grounds and in the community who can help you identify resources and options and who may be able to reduce the impact on your well-being and help you end the abuse.
	- Your voice and your body are your best weapons. Learn effective ways to use them by taking a self-defense class, and bring a friend with you.The following is a list of forms of sexual assault. They are also a violation of the University of Virginia&#39;s Policy on Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment and other Forms of Interpersonal Violence:
	- Having intercourse with another person without their consent.
	- Having intercourse with another person by force or threat of force.
	- Having intercourse with another person who is incapacitated and as a result, unable to give consent. Incapacitation can be caused by voluntary intoxication by the victim or by the perpetrator intentionally inducing ingestion of alcohol or drugs to cause incapacitation.
	- Having intercourse with another person after spiking that person&rsquo;s drink with date-rape or predatory drugs in order to induce incapacitation so that the person cannot resist or recall the incident.
	- Having intercourse with a person who is asleep, unconscious or otherwise unaware the intercourse is occurring.
	- Using threats, intimidation or coercion (unreasonable pressure) to compel someone to have intercourse against their will.Sexual Intercourse is:
	- Any penetration
	- However slight
	- With any object or body part
	- Performed by a person upon another personADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CONSENT
	- Affirmative consent must be present for all forms of sexual activity. Affirmative Consent is informed (knowing), voluntary (freely given), and active (not passive), meaning that, through the demonstration of clear words or actions, a person has indicated permission to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity.
	- Affirmative Consent cannot be obtained by Force. Force includes the use of physical violence, threats, intimidation, and/or coercion.
	- Affirmative Consent cannot be gained by taking advantage of the incapacitation of another, where the person initiating sexual activity knew or reasonably should have known that the other was incapacitated. Incapacitation means that a person lacks the ability to make informed, rational judgments about whether or not to engage in sexual activity.RESOURCES:

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- The most common type of sexual assault occurs between individuals known to one another, including an acquaintance or in the context of a current or prior dating or domestic relationship.
	- Alcohol and drugs are often used to create vulnerability to sexual assault. Studies of sexual assault incidents show a high correlation between non-stranger sexual assault and drug/alcohol usage. Be alert to people pressuring you or others to use alcohol or other drugs.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Use and encourage others to have a companion or a safe means of getting home, i.e., a trusted friend, taxi, or Safe Ride if available.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If someone is behaving disrespectfully or making you feel uncomfortable, take steps to remove yourself from the situation early, especially if you are concerned it may become physical.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- You have the right to defend your body, your personal integrity, yourself.
	- Do not second-guess yourself or the intentions of the person harming you. If you have indicated that you do not want to engage in a particular sexual activity and your partner ignores you, take this as a sign that he or she has no intention of taking your feelings into consideration. This will help you decide what to do next.
	- There is no shame in being a victim. Talk to someone who has knowledge of community and university resources. There are many people on Grounds and in the community who can help you identify resources and options and who may be able to reduce the impact on your well-being and help you end the abuse.
	- Your voice and your body are your best weapons. Learn effective ways to use them by taking a self-defense class, and bring a friend with you.The following is a list of forms of sexual assault. They are also a violation of the University of Virginia&#39;s Policy on Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment and other Forms of Interpersonal Violence:
	- Having intercourse with another person without their consent.
	- Having intercourse with another person by force or threat of force.
	- Having intercourse with another person who is incapacitated and as a result, unable to give consent. Incapacitation can be caused by voluntary intoxication by the victim or by the perpetrator intentionally inducing ingestion of alcohol or drugs to cause incapacitation.
	- Having intercourse with another person after spiking that person&rsquo;s drink with date-rape or predatory drugs in order to induce incapacitation so that the person cannot resist or recall the incident.
	- Having intercourse with a person who is asleep, unconscious or otherwise unaware the intercourse is occurring.
	- Using threats, intimidation or coercion (unreasonable pressure) to compel someone to have intercourse against their will.Sexual Intercourse is:
	- Any penetration

Affirmative Consent is informed (knowing), voluntary (freely given), and active (not passive), meaning that, through the demonstration of clear words or actions, a person has indicated permission to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity.
	- Affirmative Consent cannot be obtained by Force. Force includes the use of physical violence, threats, intimidation, and/or coercion.
	- Affirmative Consent cannot be gained by taking advantage of the incapacitation of another, where the person initiating sexual activity knew or reasonably should have known that the other was incapacitated. Incapacitation means that a person lacks the ability to make informed, rational judgments about whether or not to engage in sexual activity.RESOURCES:

The victim described the subject as a male wearing a black jacket. No additional details are known at this time. The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.

Prevention Tips
	- Remember, your room door is actually your front door. Keep it locked even when leaving only for a few minutes.
	- Report inoperable locks and latches to the appropriate maintenance personnel.
	- If you lose your key or ID, report it immediately so that locks can be changed and your lost ID can be suspended and a new one can be issued.
	- Limit the amount of personal information you post online.
	- Never leave notes on your door indicating that you are out for the night or out of town for the weekend.
	- Do not admit strangers into your residence hall.
	- Keep a written record of all personal valuables, including descriptions and serial numbers. It is evidence that the property is yours.
	- If you come home to find an unexplained open/broken window or door:

	- Do not enter - the perpetrator may still be inside.
	- Use a cell phone or neighbor&#39;s phone to call police.
	- Do not touch anything or clean up until the police have inspected for evidence.
	- Write down the license plate numbers of any suspicious vehicles.
	- Note the descriptions of any suspicious persons.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911

Prevention Tips
	- Remember, your room door is actually your front door. Keep it locked even when leaving only for a few minutes.
	- Report inoperable locks and latches to the appropriate maintenance personnel.
	- If you lose your key or ID, report it immediately so that locks can be changed and your lost ID can be suspended and a new one can be issued.
	- Limit the amount of personal information you post online.
	- Never leave notes on your door indicating that you are out for the night or out of town for the weekend.
	- Do not admit strangers into your residence hall.
	- Keep a written record of all personal valuables, including descriptions and serial numbers. It is evidence that the property is yours.
	- If you come home to find an unexplained open/broken window or door:

	- Do not enter - the perpetrator may still be inside.
	- Use a cell phone or neighbor&#39;s phone to call police.
	- Do not touch anything or clean up until the police have inspected for evidence.
	- Write down the license plate numbers of any suspicious vehicles.
	- Note the descriptions of any suspicious persons.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- The most common type of sexual assault occurs between individuals known to one another, including an acquaintance or in the context of a current or prior dating or domestic relationship.
	- Alcohol and drugs are often used to create vulnerability to sexual assault. Studies of sexual assault incidents show a high correlation between non-stranger sexual assault and drug/alcohol usage. Be alert to people pressuring you or others to use alcohol or other drugs.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Use and encourage others to have a companion or a safe means of getting home, i.e., a trusted friend, taxi, or Safe Ride if available.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If someone is behaving disrespectfully or making you feel uncomfortable, take steps to remove yourself from the situation early, especially if you are concerned it may become physical.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- You have the right to defend your body, your personal integrity, yourself.
	- Do not second-guess yourself or the intentions of the person harming you. If you have indicated that you do not want to engage in a particular sexual activity and your partner ignores you, take this as a sign that he or she has no intention of taking your feelings into consideration. This will help you decide what to do next.
	- There is no shame in being a victim. Talk to someone who has knowledge of community and university resources. There are many people on Grounds and in the community who can help you identify resources and options and who may be able to reduce the impact on your well-being and help you end the abuse.
	- Your voice and your body are your best weapons. Learn effective ways to use them by taking a self-defense class, and bring a friend with you.The following is a list of forms of sexual assault. They are also a violation of the University of Virginia&#39;s Policy on Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment and other Forms of Interpersonal Violence:
	- Having intercourse with another person without their consent.
	- Having intercourse with another person by force or threat of force.
	- Having intercourse with another person who is incapacitated and as a result, unable to give consent. Incapacitation can be caused by voluntary intoxication by the victim or by the perpetrator intentionally inducing ingestion of alcohol or drugs to cause incapacitation.
	- Having intercourse with another person after spiking that person&rsquo;s drink with date-rape or predatory drugs in order to induce incapacitation so that the person cannot resist or recall the incident.
	- Having intercourse with a person who is asleep, unconscious or otherwise unaware the intercourse is occurring.
	- Using threats, intimidation or coercion (unreasonable pressure) to compel someone to have intercourse against their will.Sexual Intercourse is:
	- Any penetration
	- However slight
	- With any object or body part
	- Performed by a person upon another personADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CONSENT
	- Affirmative consent must be present for all forms of sexual activity. Affirmative Consent is informed (knowing), voluntary (freely given), and active (not passive), meaning that, through the demonstration of clear words or actions, a person has indicated permission to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity.
	- Affirmative Consent cannot be obtained by Force. Force includes the use of physical violence, threats, intimidation, and/or coercion.
	- Affirmative Consent cannot be gained by taking advantage of the incapacitation of another, where the person initiating sexual activity knew or reasonably should have known that the other was incapacitated. Incapacitation means that a person lacks the ability to make informed, rational judgments about whether or not to engage in sexual activity.RESOURCES:

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting

	- The University Police Department offers two types of self-defense classes to the University community. The first class is the R.A.D. women&rsquo;s self-defense course. This is a 12-hour multi-session course. The second class is a one-time, two-hour basic self-defense course. There is no cost to attend these classes.
	- Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lots, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually not well-lit or heavily traveled.

	- If you are confronted, COOPERATE! Give the criminal what he/she asks for - wallet, keys, jewelry, credit cards, and electronics. Your life is more valuable than replaceable possessions. Don&rsquo;t make sudden moves or try to apprehend the criminal yourself. Concentrate on remembering a description and call police immediately.
	- Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lots, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually not well-lit or heavily traveled.
	- Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones, don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises.

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a Green Dot facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from One Less or One in Four to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- If you are being stalked, share this information with people who can help keep you safe. Use the stalking tracking form on the UVA resources website and speak to professionals to help develop a safety plan.
University (Non-Confidential) Resources: For information regarding resources and reporting options, you are encouraged to contact the University&rsquo;s Title IX Coordinator at 
mailto:titleixcoordinator@virginia.edu

Prevention Tips
	- If possible, don&rsquo;t walk alone during late-night hours. Walk in groups whenever you can&mdash;there is safety in numbers.
	- Use Safe Ride. Put their number (434-242-1122) into your speed dial. Know the Safe Ride service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- If you are confronted, COOPERATE! Give the criminal what he/she asks for - wallet, keys, jewelry, credit cards, and electronics. Your life is more valuable than replaceable possessions. Don&rsquo;t make sudden moves or try to apprehend the criminal yourself. Concentrate on remembering a description and call police immediately.
	- Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lots, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually not well-lit or heavily traveled.
	- Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones, don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises.
	- If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.
	- Know your neighborhood. Identify police and fire stations, libraries, emergency telephones &ndash; as well as the hours of operation of local stores and restaurants.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911

Unknown=09<h1>The University of Virginia shares this information to protect=
 members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the=
 likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt =
assistance should a crime occur.</h1>

<ul>
=09<li>No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsibl=
e for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following sugge=
stions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may impr=
ove opportunities to receive prompt assistance.</li>
=09<li>Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong=
, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.</li>
=09<li>Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful o=
r inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how =
you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scena=
rios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#=
39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.</li>
=09<li>Invite a Green Dot facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or org=
anization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understand=
ing of these issues by inviting a peer educator from One Less or One in Fou=
r to present to your organization.</li>
=09<li>If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who u=
nderstands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women=
&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to d=
evelop a safety plan.</li>
=09<li>If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, su=
ch as the Yellow Cab program and UPD&rsquo;s Safe Ride. Put their number, (=
434) 242-1122 into your speed dial. Know the service area and hours by visi=
ting <a href=3D"http://www.virginia.edu/parking/saferide/">http://www.virgi=
nia.edu/parking/saferide/</a>.</li>
=09<li>If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blu=
e light emergency phone or call 911.</li>
=09<li>If you are being stalked, share this information with people who can=
 help keep you safe. Use the stalking tracking form on the UVA resources we=
bsite and speak to professionals to help develop a safety plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>University (Non-Confidential) Resources: For information regarding resou=
rces and reporting options, you are encouraged to contact the University&rs=
quo;s Title IX Coordinator at <a href=3D"mailto:titleixcoordinator@virginia=

<h1>Prevention Tips</h1>

<ul>
=09<li>If possible, don&rsquo;t walk alone during late-night hours. Walk in=
 groups whenever you can&mdash;there is safety in numbers.</li>
=09<li>Use Safe Ride. Put their number (434-242-1122) into your speed dial.=
 Know the service area and hours by visiting <a href=3D"http://www.virginia=
.edu/parking/saferide/">http://www.virginia.edu/parking/saferide/</a></li>
=09<li>If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blu=
e light emergency phone or call 911.</li>
=09<li>If you are confronted, COOPERATE! Give the criminal what he/she asks=
 for - wallet, keys, jewelry, credit cards, and electronics. Your life is m=
ore valuable than replaceable possessions. Don&rsquo;t make sudden moves or=
 try to apprehend the criminal yourself. Concentrate on remembering a descr=
iption and call police immediately.</li>
=09<li>Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lot=
s, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually n=
ot well-lit or heavily traveled.</li>
=09<li>Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones,=
 don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises=
.</li>
=09<li>If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.</li>
=09<li>Know your neighborhood. Identify police and fire stations, libraries=
, emergency telephones &ndash; as well as the hours of operation of local s=
tores and restaurants.</li>
</ul>

=09<li>You have the right to defend your body, your personal integrity, you=
rself.</li>
=09<li>Do not second-guess yourself or the intentions of the person harming=
 you. If you have indicated that you do not want to engage in a particular =
sexual activity and your partner ignores you, take this as a sign that he o=

<h1>The following is a list of forms of sexual assault. They are also a vio=
lation of the University of Virginia&#39;s Policy on Sexual and Gender-Base=
d Harassment and other Forms of Interpersonal Violence:</h1>

<ul>
=09<li>Having intercourse with another person without their consent.</li>
=09<li>Having intercourse with another person by force or threat of force.<=
/li>
=09<li>Having intercourse with another person who is incapacitated and as a=
 result, unable to give consent. Incapacitation can be caused by voluntary =
intoxication by the victim or by the perpetrator intentionally inducing ing=
estion of alcohol or drugs to cause incapacitation.</li>
=09<li>Having intercourse with another person after spiking that person&rsq=
uo;s drink with date-rape or predatory drugs in order to induce incapacitat=
ion so that the person cannot resist or recall the incident.</li>
=09<li>Having intercourse with a person who is asleep, unconscious or other=
wise unaware the intercourse is occurring.</li>
=09<li>Using threats, intimidation or coercion (unreasonable pressure) to c=
ompel someone to have intercourse against their will.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Sexual Intercourse is:</h1>

<ul>
=09<li>Any penetration</li>
=09<li>However slight</li>
=09<li>With any object or body part</li>
=09<li>Performed by a person upon another person</li>
</ul>

<h1>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CONSENT</h1>

<ul>
=09<li>Affirmative consent must be present for all forms of sexual activity=
. Affirmative Consent is informed (knowing), voluntary (freely given), and =
active (not passive), meaning that, through the demonstration of clear word=
s or actions, a person has indicated permission to engage in mutually agree=
d-upon sexual activity.</li>
=09<li>Affirmative Consent cannot be obtained by Force. Force includes the =
use of physical violence, threats, intimidation, and/or coercion.</li>
=09<li>Affirmative Consent cannot be gained by taking advantage of the inca=
pacitation of another, where the person initiating sexual activity knew or =
reasonably should have known that the other was incapacitated. Incapacitati=
on means that a person lacks the ability to make informed, rational judgmen=
ts about whether or not to engage in sexual activity.</li>

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
University (Non-Confidential) Resources: For information regarding resources and reporting options, you are encouraged to contact the University&rsquo;s Title IX Coordinator at 
mailto:titleixcoordinator@virginia.edu

Prevention Tips
	- If possible, don&rsquo;t walk alone during late-night hours. Walk in groups whenever you can&mdash;there is safety in numbers.
	- Use Safe Ride. Put their number (434-242-1122) into your speed dial. Know the Safe Ride service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- If you are confronted, COOPERATE! Give the criminal what he/she asks for - wallet, keys, jewelry, credit cards, and electronics. Your life is more valuable than replaceable possessions. Don&rsquo;t make sudden moves or try to apprehend the criminal yourself. Concentrate on remembering a description and call police immediately.
	- Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lots, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually not well-lit or heavily traveled.
	- Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones, don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises.
	- If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.
	- Know your neighborhood. Identify police and fire stations, libraries, emergency telephones &ndash; as well as the hours of operation of local stores and restaurants.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.

=09=09<strong>Date and Time of Incident:</strong>
2/2/2019 at 4:30 PM
=09</p>
=09<p><strong>Report Type:</strong> Rape</p>
=09<p><strong>Reported Offense:</strong> The Charlottesville Police Departm=
ent received a report of an attempted sexual assault on February 2, 2019 at=
 6:20 PM. The reported assault occurred on February 2, 2019 at 4:30 PM, in =
the area of 10 1/2 St NW.</p>
=09<p>The survivor reports that an unknown male approached her residence an=
d asked to use her phone. The suspect then pushed his way into the residenc=
e and threatened to sexually assault her.&nbsp; If you have any information=
 about this incident please contact the Charlottesville Police Department.&=
nbsp;</p>

=09<h1>Appearance of suspect is reported to be:</h1>
At this time, a detailed description of the suspect has not been provided t=
o University Police.  =09<h1>The University of Virginia shares this informa=
tion to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to =
help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how =
to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.</h1>

<ul>
=09<li>No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsibl=
e for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following sugge=
stions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may impr=
ove opportunities to receive prompt assistance.</li>
=09<li>The most common type of sexual assault occurs between individuals kn=
own to one another, including an acquaintance or in the context of a curren=
t or prior dating or domestic relationship.</li>
=09<li>Alcohol and drugs are often used to create vulnerability to sexual a=
ssault. Studies of sexual assault incidents show a high correlation between=
 non-stranger sexual assault and drug/alcohol usage. Be alert to people pre=
ssuring you or others to use alcohol or other drugs.</li>
=09<li>Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong=
, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.</li>
=09<li>Use and encourage others to have a companion or a safe means of gett=
ing home, i.e., a trusted friend, taxi, or Safe Ride if available.</li>
=09<li>Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful o=
r inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how =
you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scena=
rios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#=
39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.</li>
=09<li>Invite a Green Dot facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or org=
anization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understand=
ing of these issues by inviting a peer educator from One Less or One in Fou=
r to present to your organization.</li>
=09<li>If someone is behaving disrespectfully or making you feel uncomforta=
ble, take steps to remove yourself from the situation early, especially if =
you are concerned it may become physical.</li>
=09<li>If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who u=
nderstands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women=
&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to d=
evelop a safety plan.</li>
=09<li>If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, su=
ch as the Yellow Cab program and UPD&rsquo;s Safe Ride. Put their number, (=
434) 242-1122 into your speed dial. Know the service area and hours by visi=
ting <a href=3D"http://www.virginia.edu/parking/saferide/">http://www.virgi=
nia.edu/parking/saferide/</a> .</li>
=09<li>If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blu=
e light emergency phone or call 911.</li>
=09<li>You have the right to defend your body, your personal integrity, you=
rself.</li>
=09<li>Do not second-guess yourself or the intentions of the person harming=
 you. If you have indicated that you do not want to engage in a particular =
sexual activity and your partner ignores you, take this as a sign that he o=
r she has no intention of taking your feelings into consideration. This wil=
l help you decide what to do next.</li>
=09<li>There is no shame in being a victim. Talk to someone who has knowled=
ge of community and university resources. There are many people on Grounds =
and in the community who can help you identify resources and options and wh=
o may be able to reduce the impact on your well-being and help you end the =
abuse.</li>
=09<li>If you are being stalked, share this information with people who can=
 help keep you safe. Use the stalking tracking form on the UVA resources we=
bsite and speak to professionals to help develop a safety plan.</li>
=09<li>Your voice and your body are your best weapons. Learn effective ways=
 to use them by taking a self-defense class, and bring a friend with you.</=
li>
</ul>

<h1>The following is a list of forms of sexual assault. They are also a vio=
lation of the University of Virginia&#39;s Policy on Sexual and Gender-Base=
d Harassment and other Forms of Interpersonal Violence:</h1>

<ul>
=09<li>Having intercourse with another person without their consent.</li>
=09<li>Having intercourse with another person by force or threat of force.<=
/li>
=09<li>Having intercourse with another person who is incapacitated and as a=
 result, unable to give consent. Incapacitation can be caused by voluntary =
intoxication by the victim or by the perpetrator intentionally inducing ing=
estion of alcohol or drugs to cause incapacitation.</li>
=09<li>Having intercourse with another person after spiking that person&rsq=
uo;s drink with date-rape or predatory drugs in order to induce incapacitat=
ion so that the person cannot resist or recall the incident.</li>
=09<li>Having intercourse with a person who is asleep, unconscious or other=
wise unaware the intercourse is occurring.</li>
=09<li>Using threats, intimidation or coercion (unreasonable pressure) to c=
ompel someone to have intercourse against their will.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Sexual Intercourse is:</h1>

<ul>
=09<li>Any penetration</li>
=09<li>However slight</li>
=09<li>With any object or body part</li>
=09<li>Performed by a person upon another person</li>
</ul>

<h1>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CONSENT</h1>

<ul>
=09<li>Affirmative consent must be present for all forms of sexual activity=
. Affirmative Consent is informed (knowing), voluntary (freely given), and =
active (not passive), meaning that, through the demonstration of clear word=
s or actions, a person has indicated permission to engage in mutually agree=
d-upon sexual activity.</li>
=09<li>Affirmative Consent cannot be obtained by Force. Force includes the =
use of physical violence, threats, intimidation, and/or coercion.</li>
=09<li>Affirmative Consent cannot be gained by taking advantage of the inca=
pacitation of another, where the person initiating sexual activity knew or =
reasonably should have known that the other was incapacitated. Incapacitati=
on means that a person lacks the ability to make informed, rational judgmen=
ts about whether or not to engage in sexual activity.</li>
</ul>

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.

Prevention Tips
	- If possible, don&rsquo;t walk alone during late-night hours. Walk in groups whenever you can&mdash;there is safety in numbers.
	- Use Safe Ride. Put their number (434-242-1122) into your speed dial. Know the Safe Ride service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- If you are confronted, COOPERATE! Give the criminal what he/she asks for - wallet, keys, jewelry, credit cards, and electronics. Your life is more valuable than replaceable possessions. Don&rsquo;t make sudden moves or try to apprehend the criminal yourself. Concentrate on remembering a description and call police immediately.
	- Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lots, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually not well-lit or heavily traveled.
	- Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones, don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises.
	- If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.
	- Know your neighborhood. Identify police and fire stations, libraries, emergency telephones &ndash; as well as the hours of operation of local stores and restaurants.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911

A description of the suspect was not provided.The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.

Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting

Incident Number: C2020-00014

Reported Offense: A shots fired incident was reported to Charlottesville and University Police on January 1, 2020 at 12:41 AM. The reported incident occurred on January 1, 2020 at 12:41 AM, at 11 Elliewood Avenue.

Shortly after 12:30 a.m., Charlottesville and University Police responded to 11 Elliewood Avenue for a report of gunshots.  Patrons leaving a bar at that location reported a subject wearing a mask firing a shot inside the bar.  There were no reported victims at the scene, but shortly after 1:00 a.m. a female victim walked into the UVA ER reporting a gunshot wound that she had received at the previously reported location.   The victim has no affiliation with the University of Virginia.  Charlottesville Police are investigating.

A description of the suspect was not provided.The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a Green Dot facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from One Less or One in Four to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- If you are being stalked, share this information with people who can help keep you safe. Use the stalking tracking form on the UVA resources website and speak to professionals to help develop a safety plan.

	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- The University Police Department offers two types of self-defense classes to the University community. The first class is the R.A.D. women&rsquo;s self-defense course. This is a 12-hour multi-session course. The second class is a one-time, two-hour basic self-defense course. There is no cost to attend these classes.
	- Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lots, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually not well-lit or heavily traveled.
	- Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones, don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises.
	- If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.
	- Know your neighborhood. Identify police and fire stations, libraries, emergency telephones &ndash; as well as the hours of operation of local stores and restaurants.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
University (Non-Confidential) Resources: For information regarding resources and reporting options, you are encouraged to contact the University&rsquo;s Title IX Coordinator at 
mailto:titleixcoordinator@virginia.edu 
titleixcoordinator@virginia.edu  or at (434) 297-7988, the Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights at 
mailto:uvaeocr@virginia.edu

Prevention Tips
	- If possible, don&rsquo;t walk alone during late-night hours. Walk in groups whenever you can. There is safety in numbers.
	- Use Safe Ride. Put their number (434-242-1122) into your speed dial. Know the Safe Ride service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- The University Police Department offers two types of self-defense classes to the University community. The first class is the R.A.D. women&rsquo;s self-defense course. This is a 12-hour multi-session course. The second class is a one-time, two-hour basic self-defense course. There is no cost to attend these classes.
	- Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lots, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually not well-lit or heavily traveled.
	- Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones, don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises.
	- If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.
	- Know your neighborhood. Identify police and fire stations, libraries, emergency telephones &ndash; as well as the hours of operation of local stores and restaurants.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911

	- Use Safe Ride. Put their number (434-242-1122) into your speed dial. Know the Safe Ride service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- The University Police Department offers two types of self-defense classes to the University community. The first class is the R.A.D. women&rsquo;s self-defense course. This is a 12-hour multi-session course. The second class is a one-time, two-hour basic self-defense course. There is no cost to attend these classes.
	- Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lots, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually not well-lit or heavily traveled.
	- Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones, don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises.
	- If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.
	- Know your neighborhood. Identify police and fire stations, libraries, emergency telephones &ndash; as well as the hours of operation of local stores and restaurants.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911

<ul>
=09<li>No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsibl=

=09<li>Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong=
, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.</li>
=09<li>Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful o=
r inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how =
you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scena=
rios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#=
39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.</li>
=09<li>Invite a Green Dot facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or org=

ing of these issues by inviting a peer educator from One Less or One in Fou=
r to present to your organization.</li>
=09<li>If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who u=

evelop a safety plan.</li>
=09<li>If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, su=
ch as the Yellow Cab program and UPD&rsquo;s Safe Ride. Put their number, (=
434) 242-1122 into your speed dial. Know the service area and hours by visi=

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.

Prevention Tips
	- If possible, don&rsquo;t walk alone during late-night hours. Walk in groups whenever you can&mdash;there is safety in numbers.
	- Use Safe Ride. Put their number (434-242-1122) into your speed dial. Know the Safe Ride service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- If you are confronted, COOPERATE! Give the criminal what he/she asks for - wallet, keys, jewelry, credit cards, and electronics. Your life is more valuable than replaceable possessions. Don&rsquo;t make sudden moves or try to apprehend the criminal yourself. Concentrate on remembering a description and call police immediately.
	- Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lots, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually not well-lit or heavily traveled.
	- Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones, don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises.
	- If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.
	- Know your neighborhood. Identify police and fire stations, libraries, emergency telephones &ndash; as well as the hours of operation of local stores and restaurants.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911

Prevention Tips
	- Remember, your room door is actually your front door. Keep it locked even when leaving only for a few minutes.
	- Report inoperable locks and latches to the appropriate maintenance personnel.
	- If you lose your key or ID, report it immediately so that locks can be changed and your lost ID can be suspended and a new one can be issued.
	- Limit the amount of personal information you post online.
	- Never leave notes on your door indicating that you are out for the night or out of town for the weekend.
	- Do not admit strangers into your residence hall.
	- Keep a written record of all personal valuables, including descriptions and serial numbers. It is evidence that the property is yours.
	- If you come home to find an unexplained open/broken window or door:

	- Do not enter - the perpetrator may still be inside.
	- Use a cell phone or neighbor&#39;s phone to call police.
	- Do not touch anything or clean up until the police have inspected for evidence.
	- Write down the license plate numbers of any suspicious vehicles.
	- Note the descriptions of any suspicious persons.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911

<h1>Prevention Tips</h1>

<ul>
=09<li>If possible, don&rsquo;t walk alone during late-night hours. Walk in=
 groups whenever you can&mdash;there is safety in numbers.</li>
=09<li>Use Safe Ride. Put their number (434-242-1122) into your speed dial.=
 Know the service area and hours by visiting <a href=3D"http://www.virginia=
.edu/parking/saferide/">http://www.virginia.edu/parking/saferide/</a></li>
=09<li>If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blu=
e light emergency phone or call 911.</li>
=09<li>If you are confronted, COOPERATE! Give the criminal what he/she asks=
 for - wallet, keys, jewelry, credit cards, and electronics. Your life is m=
ore valuable than replaceable possessions. Don&rsquo;t make sudden moves or=
 try to apprehend the criminal yourself. Concentrate on remembering a descr=
iption and call police immediately.</li>
=09<li>Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lot=
s, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually n=
ot well-lit or heavily traveled.</li>
=09<li>Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones,=
 don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises=
.</li>
=09<li>If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.</li>
=09<li>Know your neighborhood. Identify police and fire stations, libraries=
, emergency telephones &ndash; as well as the hours of operation of local s=
tores and restaurants.</li>

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- The most common type of sexual assault occurs between individuals known to one another, including an acquaintance or in the context of a current or prior dating or domestic relationship.
	- Alcohol and drugs are often used to create vulnerability to sexual assault. Studies of sexual assault incidents show a high correlation between non-stranger sexual assault and drug/alcohol usage. Be alert to people pressuring you or others to use alcohol or other drugs.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Use and encourage others to have a companion or a safe means of getting home, i.e., a trusted friend, taxi, or Safe Ride if available.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If someone is behaving disrespectfully or making you feel uncomfortable, take steps to remove yourself from the situation early, especially if you are concerned it may become physical.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- You have the right to defend your body, your personal integrity, yourself.
	- Do not second-guess yourself or the intentions of the person harming you. If you have indicated that you do not want to engage in a particular sexual activity and your partner ignores you, take this as a sign that he or she has no intention of taking your feelings into consideration. This will help you decide what to do next.
	- There is no shame in being a victim. Talk to someone who has knowledge of community and university resources. There are many people on Grounds and in the community who can help you identify resources and options and who may be able to reduce the impact on your well-being and help you end the abuse.
	- Your voice and your body are your best weapons. Learn effective ways to use them by taking a self-defense class, and bring a friend with you.The following is a list of forms of sexual assault. They are also a violation of the University of Virginia&#39;s Policy on Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment and other Forms of Interpersonal Violence:
	- Having intercourse with another person without their consent.
	- Having intercourse with another person by force or threat of force.
	- Having intercourse with another person who is incapacitated and as a result, unable to give consent. Incapacitation can be caused by voluntary intoxication by the victim or by the perpetrator intentionally inducing ingestion of alcohol or drugs to cause incapacitation.
	- Having intercourse with another person after spiking that person&rsquo;s drink with date-rape or predatory drugs in order to induce incapacitation so that the person cannot resist or recall the incident.
	- Having intercourse with a person who is asleep, unconscious or otherwise unaware the intercourse is occurring.
	- Using threats, intimidation or coercion (unreasonable pressure) to compel someone to have intercourse against their will.Sexual Intercourse is:
	- Any penetration
	- However slight
	- With any object or body part
	- Performed by a person upon another personADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CONSENT
	- Affirmative consent must be present for all forms of sexual activity. Affirmative Consent is informed (knowing), voluntary (freely given), and active (not passive), meaning that, through the demonstration of clear words or actions, a person has indicated permission to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity.
	- Affirmative Consent cannot be obtained by Force. Force includes the use of physical violence, threats, intimidation, and/or coercion.
	- Affirmative Consent cannot be gained by taking advantage of the incapacitation of another, where the person initiating sexual activity knew or reasonably should have known that the other was incapacitated. Incapacitation means that a person lacks the ability to make informed, rational judgments about whether or not to engage in sexual activity.RESOURCES:

	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- If you are confronted, COOPERATE! Give the criminal what he/she asks for - wallet, keys, jewelry, credit cards, and electronics. Your life is more valuable than replaceable possessions. Don&rsquo;t make sudden moves or try to apprehend the criminal yourself. Concentrate on remembering a description and call police immediately.
	- Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lots, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually not well-lit or heavily traveled.
	- Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones, don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises.
	- If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.

Prevention Tips
	- Remember, your room door is actually your front door. Keep it locked even when leaving only for a few minutes.
	- Report inoperable locks and latches to the appropriate maintenance personnel.
	- If you lose your key or ID, report it immediately so that locks can be changed and your lost ID can be suspended and a new one can be issued.
	- Limit the amount of personal information you post online.
	- Never leave notes on your door indicating that you are out for the night or out of town for the weekend.
	- Do not admit strangers into your residence hall.
	- Keep a written record of all personal valuables, including descriptions and serial numbers. It is evidence that the property is yours.
	- If you come home to find an unexplained open/broken window or door:

	- Do not enter - the perpetrator may still be inside.
	- Use a cell phone or neighbor&#39;s phone to call police.
	- Do not touch anything or clean up until the police have inspected for evidence.
	- Write down the license plate numbers of any suspicious vehicles.
	- Note the descriptions of any suspicious persons.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911

<h1>Prevention Tips</h1>

<ul>
=09<li>If possible, don&rsquo;t walk alone during late-night hours. Walk in=
 groups whenever you can&mdash;there is safety in numbers.</li>
=09<li>Use Safe Ride. Put their number (434-242-1122) into your speed dial.=
 Know the service area and hours by visiting <a href=3D"http://www.virginia=
.edu/parking/saferide/">http://www.virginia.edu/parking/saferide/</a></li>
=09<li>If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blu=
e light emergency phone or call 911.</li>
=09<li>If you are confronted, COOPERATE! Give the criminal what he/she asks=
 for - wallet, keys, jewelry, credit cards, and electronics. Your life is m=
ore valuable than replaceable possessions. Don&rsquo;t make sudden moves or=
 try to apprehend the criminal yourself. Concentrate on remembering a descr=
iption and call police immediately.</li>
=09<li>Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lot=
s, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually n=
ot well-lit or heavily traveled.</li>
=09<li>Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones,=
 don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises=
.</li>
=09<li>If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.</li>
=09<li>Know your neighborhood. Identify police and fire stations, libraries=
, emergency telephones &ndash; as well as the hours of operation of local s=
tores and restaurants.</li>

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.

	- Use Safe Ride. Put their number (434-242-1122) into your speed dial. Know the Safe Ride service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- The University Police Department offers two types of self-defense classes to the University community. The first class is the R.A.D. women&rsquo;s self-defense course. This is a 12-hour multi-session course. The second class is a one-time, two-hour basic self-defense course. There is no cost to attend these classes.
	- Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lots, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually not well-lit or heavily traveled.

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.

	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- The University Police Department offers two types of self-defense classes to the University community. The first class is the R.A.D. women&rsquo;s self-defense course. This is a 12-hour multi-session course. The second class is a one-time, two-hour basic self-defense course. There is no cost to attend these classes.

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
University (Non-Confidential) Resources: For information regarding resources and reporting options, you are encouraged to contact the University&rsquo;s Title IX Coordinator at 
mailto:titleixcoordinator@virginia.edu 
titleixcoordinator@virginia.edu  or at (434) 297-7988, the Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights at 
mailto:uvaeocr@virginia.edu

Prevention Tips
	- If possible, don&rsquo;t walk alone during late-night hours. Walk in groups whenever you can. There is safety in numbers.
	- Use Safe Ride. Put their number (434-242-1122) into your speed dial. Know the Safe Ride service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- The University Police Department offers two types of self-defense classes to the University community. The first class is the R.A.D. women&rsquo;s self-defense course. This is a 12-hour multi-session course. The second class is a one-time, two-hour basic self-defense course. There is no cost to attend these classes.
	- Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lots, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually not well-lit or heavily traveled.
	- Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones, don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises.
	- If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.
	- Know your neighborhood. Identify police and fire stations, libraries, emergency telephones &ndash; as well as the hours of operation of local stores and restaurants.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911

Date and Time of Incident:
2/6/2021 3:20 AM

Report Type: Burglary

Incident Number: CPD 2021-03552

Reported Offense: A burglary was reported to Charlottesville Police on February 6, 2021 at 3:20 AM. The reported incident occurred February 6, 2021 at 3:20 AM, at 400 Block 14th Street NW.

In the early morning hours of February 6th, a student residing in the 400 block of 14th Street in the City of Charlottesville awoke to a male subject wearing a black hooded sweat shirt, dark pants, and a blue face covering, standing in her room. The male subject fled, the Charlottesville Police Department was contacted, and a police report was made.

Over the past 24 hours, the University Police Department and the Office of the Dean of Students have been contacted by a number of students expressing concern about other incidents that may have been occurring off-Grounds and in the surrounding neighborhoods. The department has been in contact with the Charlottesville Police Department in an effort to gather information about incidents that may have come to their attention and the efforts that are being undertaken to investigate those reports. In that regard, University Police will continue to work with the Charlottesville Police Department to share information and work collaboratively to provide timely information to our students and parents in order that they may be best informed about how to ensure safety in their homes and as they
 travel to and from Grounds and throughout the community.

In addition to expressing concern over recent activities around off Ground housing sites, students also posed questions regarding how and under what conditions they would be alerted about crimes that may be occurring in our community. A brief explanation of the ways in which students, faculty, and staff may be notified about crime and emergency conditions may be helpful. When the University Police Department is made aware of information that presents an immediate risk to the safety and well-being of the community a Timely Warning will be sent in accordance with University Policy. In compliance with the U.S Department of Education Clery Act, Timely Warnings are sent when a report of a Clery crime is received and there is an on-going threat to the safety and well-being of our university
 community.  In certain circumstances that do not meet the criteria for a Timely Warning, a Community Alert will be sent out when there is sufficient and timely information that can be disseminated to our community without compromising an on-going criminal investigation.
Appearance of suspect is reported to be:Age:Unknown
Eye Color:Unknown
Hair Color:Unknown
Height:Unknown

Prevention Tips
	- Remember, your room door is actually your front door. Keep it locked even when leaving only for a few minutes.
	- Report inoperable locks and latches to the appropriate maintenance personnel.
	- If you lose your key or ID, report it immediately so that locks can be changed and your lost ID can be suspended and a new one can be issued.
	- Limit the amount of personal information you post online.
	- Never leave notes on your door indicating that you are out for the night or out of town for the weekend.
	- Do not admit strangers into your residence hall.
	- Keep a written record of all personal valuables, including descriptions and serial numbers. It is evidence that the property is yours.
	- If you come home to find an unexplained open/broken window or door:

	- Do not enter - the perpetrator may still be inside.
	- Use a cell phone or neighbor&#39;s phone to call police.
	- Do not touch anything or clean up until the police have inspected for evidence.
	- Write down the license plate numbers of any suspicious vehicles.
	- Note the descriptions of any suspicious persons.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911

The University of Virginia shares this information to protect members of the University community, to promote safety, to help reduce the likelihood of future crimes, and to raise awareness of how to seek prompt assistance should a crime occur.
	- No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for another person&#39;s abusive or criminal conduct. The following suggestions may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime, or may improve opportunities to receive prompt assistance.
	- Trust your instincts. If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong, do what you can to get out of that situation or call for assistance.
	- Safely intervene and/or call for help if you witness disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, or a violent crime. Plan in advance: discuss how you might do this in conversations with your friends, using different scenarios, when you aren&#39;t facing a potential crisis. Remember the three D&#39;s of Green Dot: Distract, Delegate, Direct.
	- Invite a 
Hoos Got Your Back  facilitator to your residence hall, suite, or organization to present on bystander intervention, or increase your understanding of these issues by inviting a peer educator from Culture of Respect Educators (CORE) to present to your organization.
	- If you feel as though someone may be stalking you, ask someone who understands these issues like UPD, Office of the Dean of Students, the Women&rsquo;s Center, or CAPS to help you clarify what&rsquo;s going on and to develop a safety plan.
	- If you feel afraid, call 911 or utilize transportation resources, such as the Yellow Cab Charge-a-Ride program (434) 295-4131, and P&T Safe Ride (434) 242-1122.  Put their numbers into your speed dial. Know Safe Ride&rsquo;s service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.

Prevention Tips
	- If possible, don&rsquo;t walk alone during late-night hours. Walk in groups whenever you can. There is safety in numbers.
	- Use Safe Ride. Put their number (434-242-1122) into your speed dial. Know the Safe Ride service area and hours by visiting 
	- If you feel threatened on Grounds or in nearby areas, look for a blue light emergency phone or call 911.
	- The University Police Department offers two types of self-defense classes to the University community. The first class is the R.A.D. women&rsquo;s self-defense course. This is a 12-hour multi-session course. The second class is a one-time, two-hour basic self-defense course. There is no cost to attend these classes.
	- Stay in well-lit areas as much as possible. Avoid alleys, vacant lots, wooded areas, and other short-cuts or secluded areas. They are usually not well-lit or heavily traveled.
	- Always be aware of your surroundings. If you are wearing headphones, don&rsquo;t turn up the volume so high that you cannot hear outside noises.
	- If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety.
	- Know your neighborhood. Identify police and fire stations, libraries, emergency telephones &ndash; as well as the hours of operation of local stores and restaurants.Emergency/Crisis Resources (24/7):Police911
